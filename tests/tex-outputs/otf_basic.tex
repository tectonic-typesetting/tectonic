\font\x="[lmroman12-regular]"
\x Unicode “like this” with enough characters to get us breaking the paragraph
into different lines, with some discretionary hyphenation and whatnot to make
things interesting. How much text will it take? Well, it will take less if we
use long words like antidisestablishmentarianism hypermetasuperconductivity
semihemidemiquaver prepostantepenultimate. The paragraph needs to be of
sufficient length for it to work out better to stick some hyphens in there, so
we need to keep on typing and typing and typing and come on TeX don't leave us
hanging. Here's a DESERET SMALL LETTER YEE to get us outside of the BMP: 𐐷.
