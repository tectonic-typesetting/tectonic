# The Tectonic Typesetting System

The `tectonic` crate delivers a modernized, complete, self-contained
[TeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX)/[LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/)
engine, powered by [XeTeX](http://xetex.sourceforge.net/) and
[TeXLive](https://www.tug.org/texlive/). It provides a CLI and ties together the
functionality of a large collection of sub-crates.

## Building Tectonic

The Tectonic crates collectively depend on a relatively large number of
third-party libraries. See [the Bookâ€™s build instructions][build-inst] for a
listing and guidance on setting up the build.

The crate build can be customized with the following [Cargo features]:

[Cargo features]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/features.html

- `external-harfbuzz`: build against an external version of the [Harfbuzz] text
  shaping library, rather than a vendored version (the default)
- `geturl-curl`: use the [curl] crate to implement HTTP requests. In order for
  this to take effect, you must use `--no-default-features` because
  `geturl-reqwest` is a default feature and it takes precedence
- `geturl-reqwest`: use the [reqwest] crate to implement HTTP requests (enabled
  by default)
- `native-tls-vendored`: if using [reqwest], activate the `vendored` option in
  the [native-tls] crate, causing OpenSSL to be vendored

[Harfbuzz]: https://harfbuzz.github.io/
[curl]: https://docs.rs/curl/
[reqwest]: https://docs.rs/reqwest/
[native-tls]: https://github.com/sfackler/rust-native-tls

[The Book][build-inst] describes some less-used features and provides a bit more
detail.
