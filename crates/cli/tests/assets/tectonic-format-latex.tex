% HACK ALERT!!!!
%
% Most parts of Tectonic default to using the "latex" format because that's
% what people almost always want. We also sometimes want to show "best
% practices" examples in the docs that will call for specifying the "latex"
% format. That's all good, but it does complicate the test suite -- we'd like
% to be able to run doctests or executable tests without having to actually go
% ahead and download the core set of LaTeX support files from whatever the
% current bundle is.
%
% This file is a hack to help enable this. It extends the "plain" format with
% an absolutely minimal set of control sequences necessary to compile fake
% documents that look like LaTeX. This helps our documentation look more
% realistic while avoiding making the test suite much more heavyweight.
