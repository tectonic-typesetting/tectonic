description = """
A build.rs support crate that helps deal with CARGO_CFG_TARGET_* variables.
When cross-compiling, these variables must be used instead of constructs such
as `cfg!(target_arch = ...)` because the build.rs script is compiled to
target the build host environment, not the true target environment.
