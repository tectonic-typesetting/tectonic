//! Implementations of Tectonic bundle formats.
//!
//! A Tectonic "bundle" is a collection of TeX support files. In code, bundles
//! implement the [`Bundle`] trait defined here, although most of the action in
//! a bundle will be in its implementation of [`tectonic_io_base::IoProvider`].
//!
//! This crate provides the following bundle implementations:
//!
//! - [`cache::CachingBundle`] for access to remote bundles with local
//!   filesystem caching.
//! - [`dir::DirBundle`] turns a directory full of files into a bundle; it is
//!   useful for testing and lightweight usage.
//! - [`zip::ZipBundle`] for a ZIP-format bundle.

/// A trait for bundles of Tectonic support files.
///
/// A "bundle" is an [`IoProvider`] with a few special properties. Bundles are
/// read-only, and their contents can be enumerated In principle a bundle is
/// completely defined by its file contents, which can be summarized by a
/// cryptographic digest, obtainable using the [`Self::get_digest`] method: two
/// bundles with the same digest should contain exactly the same set of files,
/// and if any aspect of a bundle’s file contents change, so should its digest.
/// Finally, it is generally expected that a bundle will contain a large number
/// of TeX support files, and that you can generate one or more TeX format files
/// using only the files contained in a bundle.
pub trait Bundle: IoProvider {
    /// Get a cryptographic digest summarizing this bundle’s contents.
    ///
    /// The digest summarizes the exact contents of every file in the bundle. It
    /// is computed from the sorted names and SHA256 digests of the component
    /// files [as implemented in the TeXLive bundle builder][x].
    ///
    /// [x]: https://github.com/tectonic-typesetting/tectonic-texlive-bundles/blob/master/scripts/ttb_utils.py#L321
