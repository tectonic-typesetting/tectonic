# Don't CI branches besides master. Pull requests still get CI'd -- but when a
# PR comes in on a branch in the same repo, this prevents it from being CI'd
# twice. Despire the name of this config item, the filtering applies to both
# branch and tag names, so to CI release tags we have to list them here too.
