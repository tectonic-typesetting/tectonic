# Temporary(?) hack: `cargo test` on OSX fails since it runs the test programs
# with DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH set (see cargo:
# src/cargo/ops/cargo_rustc/compilation.rs:fill_env()), which in our case
# interacts poorly with the fact that one of the system frameworks uses an
# internal version of libpng that clashes with the one provided by Homebrew
# (see, e.g.,
# http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17643509/conflict-between-dynamic-linking-priority-in-osx).
# This is Cargo issue #3366 on GitHub.
#
# The test programs work if we just run them manually. So, do that. This is
# not awesome since it won't scale well at all as we add more test runner
# programs.
