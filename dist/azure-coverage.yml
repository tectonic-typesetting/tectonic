# As of Rust 1.44, test executables land in target/debug/deps/ instead of
# target/debug/, which messes up current cargo-kcov (0.5.2) because it tries to
# search for those executables. Work around with `cp`. One of the `tectonic-*`
# binaries is the debug executable, which is hard-linked to
# `target/debug/tectonic`. kcov will erroneously try to run this as a test if we
# copy it, so we have to make not to do that, which we accomplish with a search
# based on the hardlink count. Hacky and fragile but this should get us going.
# Hopefully kcov will get fixed where this will become unneccessary anyway.
