//! Tectonic is a complete
//! [TeX](https://www.tug.org/)/[LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) engine
//! converted into a standalone library. It is derived from the
//! [XeTeX](http://xetex.sourceforge.net/) variant of TeX and uses the support
//! files packages by the [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) project.
//! Tectonic would not be possible without the hard work that has gone into
//! these projects.
//!
//! Because Tectonic is based on the XeTeX engine, it can take advantage of the
//! features of modern fonts (TrueType, OpenType, etc.), outputs directly to the
//! PDF file format, and supports Unicode inputs. Most importantly, the TeX
//! experience delivered by Tectonic is completely embeddable: if you link with
//! this crate you can fully process TeX documents, from source to PDF, without
//! relying on any externally installed software, configuration, or resource
//! files. This is possible because Tectonic bundles the traditional TeX tools
//! and routes their I/O through a pluggable backend system.
//!
//! This crate delivers command-line frontend, `tectonic`, that has a modernized
//! user experience that hides TeX’s copious output (by default) and never asks
//! for user input. Virtually all of the functionality of the frontend is
//! accessible programmatically through the [`driver`] module of this crate.
//!
//! This crate joins a set of sub-crates that combine to provide the Tectonic
//! user experience. Those crates generally have APIs that are more carefully
//! structured and better documented than this crate, which grew somewhat
//! organically. The foundational crates are:
//!
//! - [`tectonic_errors`](https://docs.rs/tectonic_errors) for core error
//!   handing types.
//! - [`tectonic_status_base`](https://docs.rs/tectonic_status_base) for a basic
//!   user-facing status-reporting framework.
//! - [`tectonic_io_base`](https://docs.rs/tectonic_io_base) for the I/O
//!   abstraction framework.
//! - [`tectonic_bridge_core`](https://docs.rs/tectonic_bridge_core) for a
//!   framework to launch unsafe (C/C++) "engines" through [FFI].
//!
//! [FFI]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ffi/index.html
//!
//! Building on these and other support crates of less general interest are the
//! following major pieces of Tectonic’s functionality:
//!
//! - [`tectonic_bundles`](https://docs.rs/tectonic_bundles) for the"bundles" of
//!   TeX support files underlying Tectonic processing.
//! - [`tectonic_docmodel`](https://docs.rs/tectonic_docmodel) for the Tectonic
//!   "document model" expressed in `Tectonic.toml` files.
//! - [`tectonic_engine_xetex`](https://docs.rs/tectonic_engine_xetex) for the
//!   XeTeX engine.
//! - [`tectonic_engine_xdvipdfmx`](https://docs.rs/tectonic_engine_xdvipdfmx)
//!   for the `xdvipdfmx` engine.
//! - [`tectonic_engine_bibtex`](https://docs.rs/tectonic_engine_bibtex) for the
//!   BibTeX engine.
//!
//! The main module of this crate provides an all-in-wonder function for
//! compiling LaTeX code to a PDF:
//!
//! ```
//! use tectonic;
//!
//! let latex = r#"
//! \documentclass{article}
//! \begin{document}
//! Hello, world!
//! \end{document}
//! "#;
//!
//! # tectonic::test_util::activate_test_mode_augmented(env!("CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR"));
//! let pdf_data: Vec<u8> = tectonic::latex_to_pdf(latex).expect("processing failed");
//! println!("Output PDF size is {} bytes", pdf_data.len());
//! ```
//!
//! The [`driver`] module provides a high-level interface for driving the
//! engines in more realistic circumstances.

/// Compile LaTeX text to a PDF.
///
/// This function is an all-in-one interface to the main Tectonic workflow. Given
/// a string representing a LaTeX input file, it will compile it to a PDF and return
/// a byte vector corresponding to the resulting file:
///
/// ```
/// let latex = r#"
/// \documentclass{article}
/// \begin{document}
/// Hello, world!
/// \end{document}
/// "#;
///
/// # tectonic::test_util::activate_test_mode_augmented(env!("CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR"));
/// let pdf_data: Vec<u8> = tectonic::latex_to_pdf(latex).expect("processing failed");
/// println!("Output PDF size is {} bytes", pdf_data.len());
/// ```
///
/// The compilation uses the default bundle, the location of which is embedded
/// in the crate or potentially specified in the user’s configuration file.
/// The current working directory will be searched for any `\\input` files.
/// Messages aimed at the user are suppressed, but (in the default
/// configuration) network I/O may occur to pull down needed resource files.
/// No outputs are written to disk; all supporting files besides the PDF
/// document are discarded. The XeTeX engine is run multiple times if needed
/// to get the output file to converge.
///
/// For more sophisticated uses, use the [`driver`] module, which provides a
/// high-level interface for driving the typesetting engines with much more
/// control over their behavior.
///
/// Note that the current engine implementations use lots of global state, so
/// they are not thread-safe. This crate uses a global mutex to serialize
/// invocations of the engines. This means that if you call this function from
/// multiple threads simultaneously, the bulk of the work will be done in
/// serial. The aim is to lift this limitation one day, but it will require
/// extensive work on the underlying C/C++ code.

            conditions (like using fontconfig), compiling afterwards results in
