For example, `\def\a#1{...}' and `\a}' would produce
this error. If you simply proceed now, the `\par' that
I've just inserted will cause me to report a runaway

your `}' was spurious, just type `2' and it will go away.

My plan is to forget the whole thing and hope for the best.
Use of

If you say, e.g., `\def\a1{...}', then you must always

made up of letters only. The macro here has not been

I'm forgetting what you said and not changing anything.
Sorry, \setbox is not allowed after \halign in a display,
or between \accent and an accented character.
Bad space factor
I allow only values in the range 1..32767 here.
I allow only nonnegative values here.
