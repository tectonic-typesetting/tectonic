//! This crate provides the core TeX engine implementation used by [Tectonic].
//! However, in order to obtain the full Tectonic user experience, it must be
//! combined with a variety of other utilities: the `xdvipdfmx` engine, code to
//! fetch support files, and so on. Rather than using this crate directly you
//! should probably use the main [`tectonic`] crate, which combines all of these
//! pieces into a (semi) coherent whole.

// TODO: the internal interface we're using here is pretty janky. The bibtex
// engine has a nicer approach that we should probably start using.
