//! A simple, pluggable interface for HTTP GETs and range requests.
//!
//! At the moment, there are three backends that might be available:
//! 1. A "null" backend that is always available, but does nothing and always
//!    fails.
//! 2. A backend based on [reqwest](https://docs.rs/reqwest/).
//! 3. A backend based on [curl](https://docs.rs/curl/).
//!
//! The actual backend availability is determined at build time using [Cargo
//! features][features]. See the crate README for information about the features
//! and how they interact.
//!
//! [features]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/features.html
//!
//! The default backend is intentionally exposed as a concrete type, so that
//! crates relying on this one need not use a lot of dyns and impl Traits. It is
//! intended that the choice of HTTP backend is a build-time one, not a runtime
//! one.
